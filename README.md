# Description
Just the configuration I use on my desktop running NixOS.

# Usage:
Run the following command from a NixOS installation medium:

```bash
sudo nix --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" run github:Leifrstein/nixosdots#install
```

I used LibrePhoenix's structure for a while until I found Anomalocaridid's (which resembled the basic Misterio77 starter config that I was aiming toward). All credits to the way I've organised this repo go to them.
